WindowsPhone8.1ContactsSpike
============================


Windows Phone 8.1 SDK has a peculiar issue where the application that creates the contacts is the only application that has the capabilites to get all the information of the contacts in that particular store. 

Only the contact name and the picture can be read from other contact stores. This Application or more like a spike shows you how to do retrieve the contacts and the images from the contacts store which is not created by this application.
